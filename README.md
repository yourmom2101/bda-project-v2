## 🎯 What is this project?

Imagine you want to buy a house, but you don't know if the price is fair. This project helps you predict how much a house should cost based on things like:
- 🏠 How big the house is (square feet)
- 🛏️ How many bedrooms and bathrooms it has
- 🏗️ How old the house is
- 🌳 How big the yard is

**It's like having a smart calculator that looks at thousands of house sales and learns what makes houses expensive or cheap!**

### 🎯 What does it do?

This project takes information about a house and predicts its price. It's like having a real estate expert in your computer!

**Example:**
- **Input**: "A house with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 2000 square feet, built in 1990"
- **Output**: "This house should cost around $350,000"

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Absolute Beginners (5 minutes):

1. **📥 Download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourmom2101/bda-project-v2.git
   cd bda-project-v2
   ```

2. **🐍 Install Python** (if you don't have it)
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

3. **📦 Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **🎯 Run the simple test**
   ```bash
   python test_project.py
   ```

5. **📊 Check the results**
   - Look in the `plots/` folder for beautiful graphs
   - Read the output to see how accurate the predictions are

**That's it!** You should see a graph showing how well the model predicts house prices.

### For Advanced Users:

## 🧠 How does it work? (Simple explanation)

1. **Learning Phase**: The computer looks at thousands of house sales and learns patterns
>>>>>>> c54438464bac09dc09aab5ac3cced5dc61538e72
   - "Bigger houses cost more"
   - "Newer houses cost more"
   - "Houses with more bathrooms cost more"

<<<<<<< HEAD
2. **🔮 Prediction Phase**: When you give it information about a new house, it uses what it learned to guess the price

3. **✅ Checking Phase**: It compares its guesses with real prices to see how good it is

### Technical Process:

1. **Data Loading** → Load 33,049 house records
2. **Data Cleaning** → Remove bad data, fix problems
3. **Feature Engineering** → Create new useful features
4. **Model Training** → Train 6 different AI models
5. **Model Evaluation** → Test which model works best
