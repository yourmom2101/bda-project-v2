# 🏠 Property Price Predictor - BDA V2

## What is this project? 🤔

Imagine you want to buy a house, but you don't know if the price is fair. This project helps you predict how much a house should cost based on things like:
- How big the house is (square feet)
- How many bedrooms and bathrooms it has
- How old the house is
- How big the yard is

It's like having a smart calculator that looks at thousands of house sales and learns what makes houses expensive or cheap!

## 🎯 What does it do?

This project takes information about a house and predicts its price. It's like having a real estate expert in your computer!

**Example:**
- Input: "A house with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 2000 square feet, built in 1990"
- Output: "This house should cost around $350,000"

## 🧠 How does it work? (Simple explanation)

1. **Learning Phase**: The computer looks at thousands of house sales and learns patterns
   - "Bigger houses cost more"
   - "Newer houses cost more"
   - "Houses with more bathrooms cost more"

2. **Prediction Phase**: When you give it information about a new house, it uses what it learned to guess the price

3. **Checking Phase**: It compares its guesses with real prices to see how good it is

## 📊 What kind of results do you get?

The project creates:
- **Price predictions** for houses
- **Beautiful graphs** showing how accurate the predictions are
- **Reports** explaining which features (like bedrooms, bathrooms) are most important
- **Business insights** like "Square footage is the biggest factor in house prices"

## 🎓 What makes this special?

This project follows the exact methods taught in the CBS Business Data Analytics course:
- Uses the **CRISP-DM** method (a step-by-step way to solve data problems)
- Tries **6 different types** of smart calculators (algorithms)
- Compares them to find the best one
- Focuses on **business value** - not just technical accuracy

## 🔧 Technical Details (for grown-ups)

### Algorithms Used:
1. **Linear Regression** - Simple straight-line predictions
2. **Ridge Regression** - Linear regression with extra rules
3. **Lasso Regression** - Linear regression that picks important features
4. **k-Nearest Neighbors** - Looks at similar houses to make predictions
5. **Decision Tree** - Makes decisions like "if house is big, then expensive"
6. **Random Forest** - Uses many decision trees together (most accurate!)

### Performance:
- **Best Model**: Random Forest
- **Accuracy**: 62.1% (good for house price prediction!)
- **Data**: 33,049 houses analyzed

## 🚨 Important Notes

### What you need:
- **Python 3.8 or newer** (the programming language)
- **Internet connection** (to download tools)
- **Basic computer skills** (knowing how to use the command line)

### What the project does NOT do:
- ❌ Cannot predict future market changes
- ❌ Does not consider location/neighborhood quality
- ❌ Does not account for unique features (like swimming pools)
- ❌ Cannot replace professional real estate advice

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

**For absolute beginners:**

1. **Install Python** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Download this project** (click the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP")
3. **Extract the ZIP file** to a folder on your computer
4. **Open terminal/command prompt** in that folder
5. **Run the test**: `python test_project.py`
6. **Check the results** in the `plots/` folder

**That's it!** You should see a graph showing how well the model predicts house prices.
