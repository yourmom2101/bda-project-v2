## Data Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ Excellent Features (No Missing Data)
- Taxkey, Address, District, Nbhd, Stories, Year_Built, Nr_of_rms, Fin_sqft, Units, Bdrms, Fbath, Hbath, Lotsize, Sale_date, Sale_price

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Features Requiring Attention
1. **CondoProject** (80.7% missing) - Expected for non-condo properties
2. **Extwall** (28.7% missing) - May need imputation for modeling

### üü¢ Minimal Impact Features
- **Style** (0.0% missing) - Only 6 missing values
- **PropType** (0.0% missing) - Only 3 missing values

## Key Insights

1. **High Data Quality**: 94.2% overall completeness indicates good data quality
2. **Critical Features Available**: All key numerical features (price, size, bedrooms, etc.) have complete data
3. **Expected Missing Data**: CondoProject missing data is expected since most properties are not condos
4. **Modeling Ready**: The dataset is well-suited for machine learning with minimal data cleaning needed

## Recommendations

1. **For Modeling**: Focus on the 15 complete features for initial analysis
2. **Data Imputation**: Consider imputing Extwall values for better model performance
3. **Feature Engineering**: Use CondoProject as a binary feature (condo vs non-condo)
4. **Validation**: The high completeness of critical features makes this dataset reliable for price prediction
