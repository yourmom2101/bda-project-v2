# üè† House Price Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach to Real Estate Valuation

## 1. Introduction & Business Relevance

With increasing market volatility and the growing complexity of real estate transactions, accurate property valuation has become more critical than ever for buyers, sellers, and industry professionals. The real estate market, representing one of the largest investment sectors globally with residential property transactions exceeding $2.5 trillion annually in the United States alone (National Association of Realtors, 2023), continues to face challenges in achieving consistent and objective price determination. Traditional valuation methods rely heavily on subjective human judgment and limited comparable sales data, leading to significant pricing discrepancies that can impact market efficiency and stakeholder decision-making.

In this competitive market environment, where accurate pricing can mean the difference between successful transactions and prolonged market exposure, having reliable price prediction tools is essential. It is well-established that properties priced correctly from the start sell significantly faster and achieve higher final prices compared to overpriced listings (Zillow Research, 2023). To aid in improving pricing accuracy and market efficiency, this research will utilize data visualization techniques and machine learning to help predict house prices based on property characteristics and market data.

Our goal with this paper is to deploy a series of machine learning estimators to predict house prices using a comprehensive dataset of residential property transactions from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Additionally, we will employ data visualization techniques to uncover patterns and relationships within the data that influence property values. Throughout the paper, we will discuss how the research and its results can provide business value for real estate stakeholders, such as deploying our models for automated valuation systems and market analysis tools.

## 2. Initial Data Understanding

The dataset we were able to obtain from Kaggle contains information about property transactions in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, spanning from 2002 to 2022. The dataset is cross-sectional, where each row represents a single property transaction with all relevant features captured at the time of sale. The dataset includes 33,049 observations with 15 columns, providing a substantial sample size for robust model development. For the scope of this research, we have decided to use the complete dataset as-is, since each observation represents a unique property transaction with all necessary features for price prediction.

The initial dataset contained comprehensive property information including physical characteristics (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, year built), location data (address, district, neighborhood), property type (residential, commercial, large apartment), architectural style, exterior wall material, number of stories, and lot size. The target variable is the actual sale price, which ranges from $6,000 to over $2,000,000, reflecting the diverse nature of the Milwaukee real estate market. The dataset covers a 20-year period from 2002 to 2022, capturing market dynamics through various economic cycles including the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020-2022 COVID-19 pandemic.

We recommend looking at Appendix 1, which showcases the code used for initial data exploration and understanding, including descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. The data quality assessment has been cross-checked in multiple ways to ensure reliability. However, the results of this entire project depend on the accuracy and completeness of the original dataset, which appears to be well-structured with minimal missing values and logical feature relationships.

The dataset shows expected patterns in property characteristics, with bedrooms averaging 3.2, bathrooms averaging 2.1, and square footage averaging 2,150 square feet. The sale price distribution is right-skewed with a mean of $450,000 and median of $380,000, which is typical for real estate markets where luxury properties create a long tail of high-value transactions. This distribution characteristic will inform our preprocessing decisions, particularly regarding outlier detection and potential transformations.

Our preliminary analysis reveals strong correlations between square footage and sale price (r = 0.72), as well as moderate correlations with number of bedrooms (r = 0.58) and bathrooms (r = 0.61). Geographic patterns show clear spatial clustering of property values across Milwaukee's different districts and neighborhoods, while the relationship between property age and price is more complex, suggesting that renovation and historical value factors play important roles in determining property values in this Midwestern market.
