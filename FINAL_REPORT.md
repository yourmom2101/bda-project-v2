## 2. Data Understanding and Preparation

### 2.1 Dataset Overview
- **Original Dataset**: 34,523 property records
- **Features**: 19 original features
- **Target Variable**: Sale_price
- **Data Source**: Property sales data

### 2.2 Data Quality Assessment
Initial exploration revealed several data quality issues:
- Outliers in sale prices (range: $-41,750 to $322,650)
- Missing values in critical features
- Inconsistent property characteristics
- Extreme values requiring systematic cleaning

### 2.3 Data Cleaning Methodology
Following CRISP-DM methodology, we implemented systematic cleaning:

**Price Range Filtering**: Established realistic boundaries of $10,000 to $2,000,000
**Square Footage Validation**: Excluded properties outside 200-8,000 sqft range
**Year Built Verification**: Filtered for properties built between 1900-2020
**Missing Value Treatment**: Excluded records with missing critical features

### 2.4 Feature Engineering
Created eight derived features to capture complex property relationships:
- House_Age: 2024 - Year_Built
- Total_Bathrooms: Full + half bathrooms
- Price_per_Sqft: Sale price / square footage
- Sqft_per_Bedroom: Square footage / bedrooms
- Lot_to_Sqft_Ratio: Lot size / house size
- Bathrooms_per_Bedroom: Bathroom density
- Age_Squared: Non-linear age effects
- Sqft_Squared: Non-linear size effects

### 2.5 Final Dataset
- **Cleaned Dataset**: 28,104 properties (81.4% of original)
- **Features**: 27 total (19 original + 8 engineered)
- **Data Reduction**: 11.7% due to outlier removal and missing values

## 3. Modeling Approach

### 3.1 Model Selection
We implemented four distinct algorithms to compare performance:

1. **Linear Regression**: Baseline model for linear relationships
2. **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees for non-linear patterns
3. **Gradient Boosting**: Sequential learning from prediction errors
4. **XGBoost**: Optimized gradient boosting implementation

### 3.2 Model Validation
Implemented 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation:
- **Training/Test Split**: 80%/20%
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold with R² scoring
- **Evaluation Metrics**: R², MAE, MSE, Cross-validation scores

### 3.3 Ensemble Method
Combined all four models using Voting Regressor for improved robustness and reduced overfitting risk.
