üíº Business Analyzer Module
===========================

This module analyzes the business value and practical applications of our house price predictions.
Think of it like hiring a business consultant to tell you how to use your results!

What it analyzes:
1. Business value and ROI of the predictions
2. Market insights and trends
3. Risk assessment and limitations
4. Practical applications for different stakeholders
5. Recommendations for implementation

This helps translate technical results into business value that anyone can understand.
